--   # The Instant Shipment Evaluation by Egill Antonsson
--
--   ## Disclaimer
--   Use of this software is on your own risk as it provides a powerful encouragement to "SHIP IT !",
--
--   Thus you need to be careful about when to use it (not too soon, not too late).
--
--   This software is completely predictable as it has a fixed evaluation result and does no audio processing.
